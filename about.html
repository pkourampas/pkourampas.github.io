    <h1>About This Tutorial Series</h1>

    <p>This series of <strong>Proof of Concept (POC) tutorials</strong> focuses on demonstrating how to leverage Terraform, GitHub Actions, and AWS to automate and manage infrastructure deployments, along with integrating monitoring solutions.</p>

    <p>Each scenario in the tutorial series will guide you through different lab exercises, helping you build real-world infrastructure solutions while incorporating best practices for scalability, security, and automation.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Terraform</strong>: Learn how to use Terraform for Infrastructure as Code (IaC), enabling you to define, provision, and manage AWS resources efficiently.</li>
        <li><strong>GitHub Actions</strong>: Explore how to integrate Terraform with GitHub Actions to set up CI/CD pipelines for continuous integration and continuous delivery.</li>
        <li><strong>AWS</strong>: Dive deep into AWS services like EC2, VPC, S3, and more.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Throughout these POCs, you’ll gain hands-on experience with real-world labs and scenarios, empowering you to automate infrastructure deployments, integrate monitoring solutions, and implement a streamlined CI/CD pipeline using modern DevOps tools.</p>
